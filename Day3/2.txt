5W things of PYthon ( what , who, when, where and WHY)


what is Python , 
who Developed Python 
where it was developed
when it was developed
why we need to use Python


### what is Python ?
=> Python is a high level Programming language.


=> Python is a high level Interpreted Language.


There are 2 types of Language:-
1. Interpreted Language.
2. Compiled Language


### WHO, When , WHere :-


=> Guido Van Rossum developed Python in Feb 1991, in Neitherland
=> Conceived in late 1980's .

COnceive OR Build OR Compose OR Make


see => DEKHNA
Watch => DEKHNA
look => Dekhna



## WHY :-

Task: I have to Print "Abhisheik".

------------------ in Python ------------------
print("Abhisheik")
----------------------------------------------


----------- in C language -------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Abhisheik");

    return 0;
}
------------------------------------------


--------------- in Java ----------------
public class Main

	}
}
--------------------------------------------------

--------------- in JavaScript ---------------

------------------------------------------

------------ PHP -------------------
<?php`

There are 3 types of Language:-
1. Interpreted Language.
2. Compiled Language
3. Hybrid Language

1. Interpreted Language.
=> it runs the code line by line .
=> it takes more time  to run.
=> in this case , easy to find the error.

Example: Python 


2. Compiled Language.
=> it runs the entire code at a time.
=> it takes less time to run.
=> in this case , hard to find the error

Example: Java

3.Hybrid Language :
=> it is a combination of Compiled and Interpreted.
Example: Javascript
